# Lets Build a Gem

So...you want to build a gem! Awesome, I hope this repo of information and links will help 
you on your journey to build new gems and give back to the Ruby community that is so great. 

I have put together a list of links that I found helpful when I was creating my first gem. 
Also, this readme acts as a topical guide to building a gem. If you have any questions, 
please post an issue. 

## File Structure 

The basic file structure for a gem is relatively simple after you have seen it a couple 
of times. 

- lib/
  - traits.rb
  - traits/
- test/
  - test_helper.rb
- Rakefile
- LICENSE.txt
- gem-name.gemspec
